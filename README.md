# SalesMVC

This is a project that i've created along a C# course on Udemy, teached by Nelio Alves.
If you're interested, check it out https://www.udemy.com/course/programacao-orientada-a-objetos-csharp/

I have a plenty of difficulties while building this project (almost trying by myself)
starting with the fact that i was using a different framework from the one presented in the course, that was kinda challenging!

But with alot of research, i finally made it clear to me what is a MVC!


 This project is a basic sales website, constructed under MVC pattern and working with mysql database.
Has simple operational features like add new sellers, new departments, products and some searching by the user.
